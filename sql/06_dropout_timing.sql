-- Question:
-- Is there a pattern in attendance before students drop out?
--
-- we compare attendance in the final 30 days before a student'savepoint
-- last recorded attendance with thier attendance eairier in the course.
--
-- since we do not have an actual droupout date, the student's 
-- last recorded attendance 

WITH last_attendance AS (
-- Find the last attendance date for each student who eventually dropped out
SELECT 
    a.enrolment_id,
    MAX(a.session_date) AS last_attendance_date
    
    FROM attendance a
    JOIN enrolments e ON e.enrolment_id = a.enrolment_id
    WHERE e.status = 'Dropped'
    GROUP BY enrolment_id
)
-- Compare attendance in the final 30 days with attendace earlier in the course.
SELECT 
   CASE 
     WHEN DATEDIFF(la.last_attendance_date, a.session_date) <=30
     THEN 'Last 30 days'
     ELSE 'Earlier'
     END AS period,
     
     ROUND(
       100 * SUM(a.status IN ('Present', 'Late')) / COUNT(*), 1
       ) AS attendance_rate,
       
       COUNT(*) AS sessions
	FROM attendance a
    JOIN last_attendance la ON a.enrolment_id= la.enrolment_id
    
    WHERE a.status <> 'Not Recorded'
      AND a.session_date <= la.last_attendance_date
      GROUP BY period;
	
    -- Result:
    --
    -- Attendance drops sharply before students leave.
    -- Attendance is 53.8%  earlier in  the course but fails to
    -- 16.6% in the final 30 days before their last recorded attendance.
    -- 
    -- this show that declining attendance is a clear pattern
    -- among students who eventually drop out.
